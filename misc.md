## Misc DOM manipulation and frontend stuff 

- `data-*` forms a class of custom data attributes 
    - Allows proprietary info to be exchanged between the `HTML` and the DOM, usable in scripts 
    - The `HTMLElement.dataset` property gives access 
- Sometimes linking JS and CSS assets through CDN gives out cached data while real time data is different. 

#### Terminology 
- CDN - content delivery network
